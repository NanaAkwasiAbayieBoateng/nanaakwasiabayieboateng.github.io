My name is Nana Boateng. I am a Statistician, Econometrician  and a Data Scientist:

- I am interested in Applying mathematics, statistics,economics and computer science concepts in solving business, economic, finance and industrial problems. 
- I am broadly interested in applied statistical methods such as non-parametric methods,exact statistical methods, bayesian inference, hierachical/multilevel  models, time series, survival analysis ,Markov Chain Monte-carlo etc. 
- Machine learning (deep learning, recommender systems, natural language processing, network analysis), Clustering Algorithms,   Dimensionality Reduction   
- Sample Size Estimation and Power Analysis. 
- Optimization techniques (linear / nonlinear programming, dynamic / stochastic programming) 
- Quantitative finance ( Monte Carlo simulation, risk quantification, portfolio optimization, economic scenario generation)  
- Distributed computer  storage and processing : Spark, SQL ,GPU computing  


###  Programming Languages: 
-  R, Matlab, Python,Julia,Scala, C++, Octave, SAS, Stata


###   My History 
 I  begun my  academic research career  in  bio-statistical fields such as applying statistical models in investigating  pediatric  and thoracic oncology. I have being involved in applying state of the art machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques in solving problems in the automobile industry, finance and insurance industries.
